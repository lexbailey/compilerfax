Some problems that I came across when using hylafax on raspbian:

during setup, using faxaddmodem: ondelay is not able to contact the modem, and hangs
fix option 1: rename ondelay so that faxaddmodem can't find it and uses the builtin code instead
fix option 2: modify faxaddmodem so that it doesn't even try to use ondelay
fix option 3: manually construct the config file for the modem

faxrecvd looks for config in /var/spool/hylafax/etc, but it is bind-mounted to /etc/hylafax when the faxgetty service starts
fix: modify the faxrecvd file to look in /etc/hylafax instead
